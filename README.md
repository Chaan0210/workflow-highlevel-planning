# Analysis of High-Level Planning Structure in Agents (Under research)

## Introduction

## Setup

## Methodology

## Acknowledgements & License Compliance

This project is built upon the **OAgents** framework, which is originally adapted from the **smolagents** library. We sincerely appreciate the contributions of both the OAgents and smolagents teams for providing excellent open-source foundations.

### Modifications

In accordance with the Apache License 2.0, we state the following changes made to the OAgents framework for this research:

1.  **High-Level Planning Structure:** We modified the planning module to compare different workflow structures (e.g., Reactive, Sequential, DAG) and analyze their impact on agent performance.
2.  **Experimental Setup:** The codebase has been adjusted to execute specific benchmarks (e.g., GAIA) with customized configurations for our comparative study.
